# PowerBI-Themes

A collection of pre-branded theme files (JSON) for Power BI reports and dashboards.

## Instructions for usage

1. First check that you have the latest version installed (should be September 2019 or newer).
2. Import the theme using "Home" > "Switch Theme" > "Import theme" in the Power BI Ribbon.
3. For any colors or fonts that appear incorrect, select the visual, navigate to the colors or fonts setting and select "Revert to Default".
4. If "revert to default" does not fix the issue, try manually selecting the color or font that looks best.
5. Open an Issue (or create a PR) if you find any bugs or ways to improve.
